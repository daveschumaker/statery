# statery

An extremely simple and just as experimental state management library for React. Yes, another one. Honestly, even I don't know why this even exists. I had an idea and just _had_ to try it, and yet another NPM package was born.

**Do not use this library. It's terrible.** In fact, do not use any other library, either. They're all terrible.

### Assumptions:

- A store should only contain data. Mutators should be normal functions.
- Shallow updates are good enough
- Supports React Hooks only
